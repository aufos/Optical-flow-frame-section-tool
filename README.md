# Research-Project

## Current functionality:

This tool was designed to import and select frames in videos to be used in the evaluation of real-world optical flow datasets. Currently, the tool supports the following functionatilies:

- Import of a video (.mp4, .avi, .mov)
- Selection of frames through a slider.
- Selection of frames via a timestamp input. Used for general. Most hollistic approach. 
- Selection of frames via _Previous_ and _Next_ Buttons. Most granular approach.
- An offset input field, which shows how many many frames apart the two images are. By default, this is set to 1.
- The ability to zoom both images, such that pixels can be very clearly mapped and located between frames. 
- The ability to export the selected frame pairs in KITTI format.
